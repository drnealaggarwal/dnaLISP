* Preamble

Here you will find my C source files which I am creating as I teach my
students how to develop a computer programming language. In addition
to teaching the Nand2Tetris program (of Nisan and Schocken fame) I
teach students to develop their own programming language. Those who
survive this course learn a 'gestalt' appreciation for programming
that many have said changed their programming careers forever.

* How this works

We are going to develop our own programming language using the C
programming language to do it. The language we will develop will be a
type of LISP. It will take approximately 1000 lines of C code to
develop our language and at the end of the course you'll have such an
understanding of how computers do what they do that you'll be changed
forever. 

And you'll have learned C and LISP at the same time!

* Follow along with me

I suggest that you type in all the code that I send to you in emails
or give out in handouts or that you get as source from this repository
here. Type it all out yourself ... every single character,
every single line. Then you should compile each program as we go
along. I provide explanations on how to do this all the way
through the course. You use the fantastic library at your fingertips
through that magnificent librarian -- GOOGLE -- and learn a most 
important skill -- how to learn on your own.

If you take a shortcut and clone this repo to your machine you'll not
get as much benefit as you would if you typed it all in line by
line. But having said that do clone it to your computer so you have
all the files you'll need to follow along and to compare with your 
own attempts. But do type in the code yourself; DON'T CUT & PASTE!
I provide this repo here so that you can compare my code with
yours when you are stuck and to make sure that you are on the right
track at all times.

* Happy programming and welcome to our class!
